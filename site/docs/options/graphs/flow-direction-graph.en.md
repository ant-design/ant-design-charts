title: Flow Direction Graph
order: 6
---

Used to visually display flow paths and value changes.

```js
import { FlowDirectionGraph } from '@ant-design/graphs';
```

## When to Use

Ideal for complex information that requires clear logical relationships or decision support. It visually and clearly shows data flow and relationships, improving understanding and decision-making efficiency.

## Code Examples

<code id="demo-flow-direction-graph-default" src="./demos/flow-direction-graph/default.tsx" description="A simple demonstration.<br> Adjust `edge.style.lineWidth` via the interaction `map-edge-line-width`. It includes the following properties:<br> - `value` (number or function to compute the value of the edge)<br> - `minValue` and `maxValue` (optional, minimum and maximum values, can be numbers or functions)<br> - `minLineWidth` and `maxLineWidth` (optional, minimum and maximum line widths, can be numbers or functions)<br> - `scale` (optional, interpolation function to map values to line widths, supports `'linear'`, `'log'`, `'pow'`, `'sqrt'`, and custom interpolation functions)">Basic Usage</code>
