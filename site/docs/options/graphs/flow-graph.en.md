title: Flow Graph
order: 5
---

Used to visually represent the steps and decision points of a process or system.

```js
import { FlowGraph } from '@ant-design/graphs';
```

## When to Use

A flowchart shows the entire process from start to finish. Each node represents a specific step or decision point, and the edges indicate the sequence and relationships between steps.

- Suitable for scenarios that require displaying linear processes or steps.
- Useful for planning and tracking project progress, clarifying task order and dependencies.
- Ideal for building decision trees, showing different decision points and paths.
