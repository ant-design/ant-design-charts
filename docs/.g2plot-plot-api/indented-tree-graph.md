Set the height of the graph.

#### data

Data, see the sample code, `title`、`body`、`footer` only for nodeType: `card`, other nodeType types use label.

```ts
// value、valueStyle only apply to `footer`.
interface Items {
  content: string | number;
  value?: string | number;
  style?: LabelStyle;
  valueStyle?: LabelStyle;

// Refer to the sample code for details.
interface Data {
  id: string;
  title?: NodeConfig;
  body?: NodeConfig;
  footer?: NodeConfig;
  children?: Data[];
  [key: string]?: unknow
}
```

#### edgeType

### Functions

#### graph.downloadFullImage(name, type, imageConfig)

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| name | String | false | The name of the image. 'graph' by default. |
| type | `'image/png'` / `'image/jpeg'` / `'image/webp'` / `'image/bmp'` | false | The type of the image. When the `renderer` of the graph is `'canvas'`(default), `type` takes effect. When the `renderer` is `'svg'`, `toFullDataURL` will export a svg file |

### Events

Events are bound to the Graph by 'on' and removed by 'off'. OnReady returns the Graph instance.

```ts
graph.on(eventName, (evt) => {});
graph.off(eventName, (evt) => {});
```

```ts
{
  onReady: (graph) => {
    graph.on('node:mouseenter', (evt) => {
      const item = evt.item;
      graph.setItemState(item, 'hover', true);
    });
    graph.on('node:mouseleave', (evt) => {
      const item = evt.item;
      graph.setItemState(item, 'hover', false);
    });
  };
}
```

Where, the event object `evt` has the properties:

- `type`: The type of the event
- `name`: The name of the event
- `x`: The x coordinate on the canvas
- `y`: The y coordinate on the canvas
- `clientX`: The x coordinate about the client
- `clientY`: The y coordinate about the client
- `canvasX`: The x coordinate about parent DOM of the canvas
- `canvasY`: The y coordinate about parent DOM of the canvas
- `item`: The item being manipulated, which can be a node, an edge, or a Combo）
- `target`: The target Shape on the `item` being manupulated, or the canvas instance
- `bubbles`: Whether bubbles
- `defaultPrevented`: Whether prevent the original event
- `originalEvent`: The original client event object. where the `button` can be used to distinguish the left/middle/right button of the mouse on some events like `click` or `dblclick`
- `timeStamp`: The time stamp the event triggered
- `propagationStopped`: Wheher stop the propogation
- `propagationPath`: The triggering path

`eventName` can be refered to the following parts.
