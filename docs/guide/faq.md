## FAQ

Here is a roundup of some common questions and official responses from the Ant Design Charts community.

### 1、 What is the relationship between G2, G2Plot and Ant Design Charts?

- Same team development.
- G2Plot based on G2, which uses grammar of graphics and is relatively expensive to use and powerful.
- G2Plot is an overlay wrapper over G2, replacing the graph syntax with configuration items.
- Ant Design Charts is the React version of G2Plot, which synchronizes functionality with G2Plot and has built-in graph-related Charts such as flowcharts, organizational Charts, etc
- Some of the other charts were implemented by students on other teams based on G2 or G2Plot

### 2、Object(...) is not a function

The React version is too low and does not support hooks. Updated to version 16.
