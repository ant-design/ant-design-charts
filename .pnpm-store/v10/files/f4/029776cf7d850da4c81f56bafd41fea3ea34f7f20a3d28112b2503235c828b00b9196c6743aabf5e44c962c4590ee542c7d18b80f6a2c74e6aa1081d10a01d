The graphics and event system is compatible with the DOM Element & Event API, and the animation system is compatible with the Web Animations API, so it can be adapted to existing Web-side ecologies such as D3, Hammer.js gesture library, etc. at a very low cost.

The usage is as follows, providing the following core objects and APIs.

```js
import { Canvas, Circle } from '@antv/g';
```

It is necessary to work with [Renderer](https://g-next.antv.vision/en/docs/api/renderer/renderer) to draw the graphics out.
