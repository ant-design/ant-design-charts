  };
}
```

## Events

Events are bound to the Graph by 'on' and removed by 'off'. OnReady returns the Graph instance.

```ts
graph.on(eventName, (evt) => {});
graph.off(eventName, (evt) => {});
```

```ts
{
  onReady: (graph) => {
    graph.on('node:mouseenter', (evt) => {
      const item = evt.item;
      graph.setItemState(item, 'hover', true);
    });
    graph.on('node:mouseleave', (evt) => {
      const item = evt.item;
      graph.setItemState(item, 'hover', false);
    });
  };
}
```

Where, the event object `evt` has the properties:

- `type`: The type of the event
- `name`: The name of the event
- `x`: The x coordinate on the canvas
- `y`: The y coordinate on the canvas
- `clientX`: The x coordinate about the client
- `clientY`: The y coordinate about the client
- `canvasX`: The x coordinate about parent DOM of the canvas
- `canvasY`: The y coordinate about parent DOM of the canvas
- `item`: The item being manipulated, which can be a node, an edge, or a Combo）
- `target`: The target Shape on the `item` being manupulated, or the canvas instance
- `bubbles`: Whether bubbles
- `defaultPrevented`: Whether prevent the original event
- `originalEvent`: The original client event object. where the `button` can be used to distinguish the left/middle/right button of the mouse on some events like `click` or `dblclick`
- `timeStamp`: The time stamp the event triggered
- `propagationStopped`: Wheher stop the propogation
- `propagationPath`: The triggering path

`eventName` can be refered to the following parts.
